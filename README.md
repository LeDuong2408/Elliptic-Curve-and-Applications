# Elliptic-Curve-and-Applications
1. Mathematical basic:
- Definition of Elliptic curve on finite field P 
- Addition on Elliptic Curve
- Multiplication on Elliptic curve (Using methol double and add)
2. Algorithm:
- Key exchange:
    + Elliptic curve Deffie-Hellman
    + ECMQV (Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone)
- Encoding and decoding:
    + Encoding ElGamal
    + ECIES (The Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption System)
- Digital signatue:
    + ECDSA (The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)
    + Digital signature ElGamal
3. Application:
- Chat app: using Encoding ElGamal algorithm and Digital signature ElGamal algorithm to send and recive message
- Banking: using Digital signature ElGamal algorithm to authentication and compelete transaction
